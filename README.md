# DDD Course Workshop

Repository ready to doing implementing the DDD.

## Run
```bash
git clone git@github.com:simara-svatopluk/ddd-course-workshop.git
cd ddd-course-workshop
composer install
composer check
```

We don't live in caves, so always run tests, check PSR-2 and run static analysis.  
Command `composer check` does all of it.
